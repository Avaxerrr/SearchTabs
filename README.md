# SearchTabs

SearchTabs is a lightweight desktop wrapper application for Perplexity that brings tabbed browsing functionality to your research workflow. Built using Python with PySide6, this unofficial app allows you to conduct multiple research sessions simultaneously without the need to open a web browser or juggle between windows. Unlike the official Perplexity desktop application which limits users to a single session, SearchTabs enables seamless multitasking with its intuitive tab system - perfect for researchers, students, and professionals who need to explore multiple topics efficiently.

## Releases

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/Avaxerrr/SearchTabs_Perplexity_Desktop_Alternative/releases) page for the latest versions and download options. Each release includes detailed notes about new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

## Known Limitations

- **No Voice Search**: Voice search functionality is not supported as it's only available in the official Perplexity desktop app and mobile versions, not in the web interface.
- **Rendering Issues**: Users may experience occasional black screens when resizing the application window due to limitations in the Qt WebEngine. This issue is planned to be addressed in an upcoming release.
- **Platform Availability**: Currently limited to Windows since I don't have Mac or Linux to package the app as of the moment.
- **Theme Synchronization**: When changing the app theme to dark/light mode, Perplexity's interface does not automatically adjust. Users need to manually change the theme in Perplexity's settings.

## Development Roadmap
**Upcoming versions of SearchTabs aim to include the following features:**
- **Find in Page**: Ctrl+F functionality for searching content
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize to system tray for background operation
- **Always on Top**: Option to keep the window above other applications
- **Enhanced Tab Management**: Option to reopen previously closed tabs
- **UI Improvements**: Draggable tabs and refined interface elements
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved memory management and startup time
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Extending availability to macOS and Linux

These features will be implemented gradually in future updates, enhancing the functionality and user experience of SearchTabs over time.
